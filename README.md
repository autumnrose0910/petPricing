This code allows for a pet to shop keep track of the animals they have available, both cats and dogs. Each animal has a monthly licensing rate that varies depending on the weight of the pet in pounds. The system will not only keep track of their petsavailable, but also calculate the total amount they pay on licensing fees each month.
